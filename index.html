     <h2>My profile</h2>
     <p>So I am Ronan Gaysse, a first year student in a management school. It would be too simple to just say that I am motivated and dynamic, so I will try to present myself better. Indeed my main quality, in my opinion, is that I am very comfortable with others and with teamwork. I'm not afraid to take the lead to make things happen and I'm not afraid of responsibility. Furthermore, I am very autonomous in my work. Finally, if I had to name one, many consider ambition to be a defect.</p>

     <h2>My skills</h2>
      <p> I believe in the importance of languages in today's world, which is why I am fluent in English - my school lessons are in English - but I also study Chinese and have practised German in junior high and high school.  In the same way, mastering IT tools is essential. I use tools such as Word, Excel, Powerpoint but also Microsoft Teams and Zoom on a daily basis, tools that are proving very useful these days.</p>

     <h2>Professional experience</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>
        <p>Required secondary school internship (period 2016-2017): I did my first internship at Lectra, an international company that markets machines and software for cutting leather, fabrics and other materials for different sectors such as automotive, fashion and furniture. This first experience allowed me to discover in depth the world of business. This one-week training course opened my eyes to the different jobs in the company and was a major event in my choice of orientation.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>Required internship at high school (period 2017-2018): I did my second internship, of one week, in a pharmaceutical company, AB Science. I have always been interested in medicine and drugs. During this internship, I was able to observe the different departments of this complex company as it combines science for medical research as well as commerce to sell and spread the products. This internship was very exciting for me and reinforced the idea of working in a wide range of business areas.</p>

     <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
     <p>I play on my school's rugby team and I really enjoy playing this sport. Beyond the sporting aspect, what I particularly like about rugby is the state of mind. The team is very important, so we forge very strong bonds. Rugby is also a sport where you shouldn't be afraid of contact, so it forges the mind.  Then it's quite classic, but I enjoy it a lot with my friends.</p>
